## Notes for Agent
<!-- Instructions for the AI agent on how to use this database -->
1. Select experiences most relevant to the job description
2. Use varied action verbs: built, developed, designed, implemented, optimized, led, managed
3. Quantify impacts with realistic metrics (15-30% improvements, not 10x)
4. Match the tone to the company culture (startup vs enterprise)
5. Emphasize technologies mentioned in the job posting
6. Keep to 2 pages maximum unless senior position requires more
7. Use keywords naturally within context, not forced
8. Prioritize recent experience unless older experience is more relevant
