## 📈 RESULTS & AUTOMATION (11:24-11:54)

**🎬 VEO 3 VIDEO #3** (15 seconds) - The Transformation

```
Veo 3 Prompt: "First-person POV sitting at a desk. Start with a single paper resume being hand-written slowly with a pen, clock on wall shows time passing slowly. Suddenly, an electric blue AI energy wave flows across the desk from left to right. After the wave passes, the scene transforms: the desk now has a laptop showing a terminal with code scrolling rapidly, stacks of completed resumes appearing one by one in quick succession on the desk, digital email icons flying out from the laptop screen into the air like paper airplanes. The clock on the wall spins forward rapidly. The transformation shows manual slow work becoming instant AI automation. Smooth camera movement, professional office lighting, modern tech aesthetic, blue and white color scheme."
```

**Why this works:**
- **Visual story** - Shows before/after transformation in one shot
- **No text generation** - Veo 3 doesn't need to spell anything
- **Relatable POV** - First-person makes it personal
- **Clear metaphor** - Manual → AI automated
- **15 seconds** - Perfect length for the transformation
- **Professional** - Office setting, clean aesthetic
- **Energy and motion** - AI wave, emails flying, clock spinning

**Alternative (if POV doesn't work well):**
```
Veo 3 Prompt: "Wide shot of a modern office desk. Left side: person manually writing resumes by hand, papers stacked messily, frustrated expression, wall clock ticking slowly. Center: a bright blue lightning bolt strikes the desk. Right side: same person now relaxed, smiling, laptop open with terminal showing automation, completed resumes organized in neat stacks, digital email icons launching into the air automatically, wall clock spinning rapidly. Split-screen transformation, professional lighting, tech aesthetic, blue energy effects."
```

**Transition:** Video fades to you on camera

### Part 1: The Results (30 seconds)

**📹 YOU ON CAMERA or VOICEOVER over simple graphics**

**Show simple text overlays (not detailed spreadsheet):**

**Voiceover:**

![[Before After.excalidraw]]
```
"The results speak for themselves.

Before this system: 3 interviews from 50 applications. 75 hours of manual work.

After building this agent: 18 interviews from 50 applications. 2.5 hours total.

6x more interviews. 72 hours saved.

[Pause]

Same experience. Same qualifications. Better delivery.

And you can go even further.

Want full automation? Use n8n or Claude Code agents to auto-send these resumes.
Auto-apply to jobs. Auto-follow-up with recruiters.

The agent creates the resume. The automation handles the rest.

You just review the offers."
```

**Editing Notes:**
- Simple, clean text overlays (not busy spreadsheets)
- Show the "6x more interviews" as hero metric
- Quick mention of n8n/Claude Code for full automation
