## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: High-Volume Applications
**Scenario:** Apply to 50+ jobs per week

**Before:**
- 90 min per resume × 50 = 75 hours
- Generic resume = 12% response rate
- 6 responses, 3 interviews

**After:**
- 3 min per resume × 50 = 2.5 hours
- Tailored resume = 44% response rate
- 22 responses, 18 interviews

**Result:** 72.5 hours saved, 6x more interviews

---

### Use Case 2: Career Transition
**Scenario:** Software engineer → DevOps engineer

**Challenge:** Highlight infrastructure experience hidden in backend role

**Solution:**
- Experience DB contains: K8s migration, AWS optimization, CI/CD setup
- Agent extracts and emphasizes these for DevOps roles
- De-emphasizes frontend work
- Positions you as infrastructure-focused

**Result:** Seamless narrative for new role

---

### Use Case 3: Multiple Simultaneous Searches
**Scenario:** Apply to both senior IC and management roles

**Before:** Maintain 2 separate resumes manually

**After:**
- Same experience DB
- Agent creates IC resume: Emphasizes technical depth
- Agent creates manager resume: Emphasizes team leadership
- Both authentic, from same source

**Result:** One source of truth, infinite variations

## 📈 Success Metrics

### How to Track Your Results

Create a simple spreadsheet:

```
| Date | Company | Role | Response? | Interview? | Offer? | Notes |
|------|---------|------|-----------|------------|--------|-------|
| 2025-10-01 | CompanyA | Senior SWE | Yes | Yes | Pending | Great culture fit |
| 2025-10-02 | CompanyB | Staff Eng | No | - | - | Too senior |
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Response Rate:** Target 40%+ (was 12%)
- **Interview Rate:** Target 35%+ of responses
- **Time per Application:** Target under 5 minutes
- **Offer Rate:** Track to optimize further

### Optimization Tips
- **If response rate is low (<30%):** Increase keyword match, improve summary
- **If interview rate is low:** Revise experience bullets for impact
- **If offers are low:** Focus on interview prep, not resume

---

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Claude isn't matching keywords well
**Solution:**
- Ensure your experience DB has detailed technical terms
- Add more quantified metrics
- Include specific technologies, not just "cloud" but "AWS, GCP, Azure"

### Issue: Generated resumes feel generic
**Solution:**
- Add more specific project details to experience DB
- Include unique achievements, not just job duties
- Give Claude more context in the prompt (company research, role nuances)

### Issue: ATS rejecting resumes
**Solution:**
- Use simple formatting (no tables, complex layouts)
- Stick to standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Export to PDF from Markdown (cleanest format)
- Test with Jobscan or similar ATS checkers

### Issue: Resume is too long (>2 pages)
**Solution:**
- In the prompt, specify: "Maximum 2 pages, prioritize last 5 years"
- Remove older or less relevant experience from DB for that specific job
- Focus on achievements, not duties
