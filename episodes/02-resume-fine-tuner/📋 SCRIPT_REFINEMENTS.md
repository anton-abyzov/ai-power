# 📋 Script Refinements - October 1, 2025

## Updates Made Based on Feedback

---

## 1. ✂️ Shortened LaTeX Section

### Before (90 seconds):
- Detailed explanation of Overleaf workflow
- Step-by-step LaTeX template selection
- Long voiceover about copy/paste/compile process
- Heavy emphasis on LaTeX as primary method

### After (60 seconds):
- Quick scroll through 100+ resumes
- Brief mention LaTeX is optional but powerful
- Emphasis: **"You don't NEED LaTeX"**
- Simple text file works great
- LaTeX available for beautiful PDFs if wanted

### Key Script Change:
```
"Now here's the key: You don't NEED LaTeX. Simple text file with your
experience works great. But LaTeX? Beautiful PDFs if you want them.

Claude generates the content. You choose the format."
```

**Why This Works Better:**
- Less intimidating for non-technical users
- Emphasizes simplicity first
- LaTeX becomes a bonus, not a requirement
- Broader appeal to all professions

## 2. 🔧 Added Agent Calling Methods

### Two Ways to Call Agents:
1. **With @ symbol:** `@resume-fine-tuner`
2. **Just the name:** `resume-fine-tuner`

### Where Added:

**In Script (Line 994-996):**
```markdown
**Note:** You can call the agent two ways:
- `@resume-fine-tuner` (using @ symbol)
- Just type `resume-fine-tuner` (agent name directly)
```

**In Voiceover (Line 1002):**
```
"Call the agent with @ symbol or just the name. Either works."
```

**In Workspace Docs:**
- Updated `README.md`
- Updated `DEMO_COMMANDS.md`
- Added clarification for viewers

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows flexibility
- Users can choose their preferred method
- Makes agent usage more accessible
- Quick tip during demo
