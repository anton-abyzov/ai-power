## 📝 Updated Voiceover Script

```
"Quick setup note: I'm opening VS Code for the workspace, but running
Claude Code from the terminal.

[Show VS Code with terminal panel]

You can open as many terminals as you want. Need to test something while
the agent runs? Open another terminal. Need to check files? Another one.

VS Code for editing. Terminal for full Claude Code power.

[Switch to Claude Desktop app - Usage page]

Now here's something new: Claude Desktop finally delivered token-based usage
tracking. No more cc command needed.

[Show usage bars]

See these bars? That's your token usage. 'Current session' resets every
5 hours. 'Weekly limits' track all models and Opus separately.

The tokens accumulate during that 5-hour window. Use a lot in one session?
You'll see it here. Simple, transparent, built-in.

This is why Claude Code is the future."
```
