### üî• HOOK (0:00-0:30)
**[Scene: Split screen - One developer manually editing resumes, another using AI]**
*üìπ [See VIDEO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md ‚Üí Split-Screen Recording section for OBS setup]*

"You won't be replaced by AI. But you WILL be replaced by someone using AI to do YOUR job faster and better."

**[Screen: Inbox flooding with 50+ recruiter messages]**

"Watch how to turn ANY resume into the PERFECT match for ANY job - in 2 minutes. Works for developers, marketers, project managers, real estate agents, teachers, consultants, designers - literally ANY professional."

![[Broad vs Focused.excalidraw]]

"Generic resume = ignored. Tailored resume = interview. But who has time to customize for EVERY opportunity?"

**[Screen: Scroll through LinkedIn showing 50+ unread messages]**

"The opportunities are EVERYWHERE - remote, high-paying, waiting. You just need the right approach."

### üöÄ CLAUDE CODE AGENTS (1:00-2:30)
**[Screen: Claude Code interface]**

"Claude Code agents - AI assistants that follow YOUR exact instructions. In Episode 1, we built portfolios with UI agents. Now we're creating something even more powerful."

**[YouTube Card @ 1:10: "Episode 01: Portfolio Builder" - top right]**

**[Show Excalidraw: Agent Architecture Diagram]**
![[Agent workflow.excalidraw]]

"Think of it like this: You feed the agent your ENTIRE career history once. Every project, every skill, every achievement. Then it becomes your personal resume expert, instantly matching your experience to ANY job description."

**[Quick examples on screen with vocal cues]**
"Watch the transformation:
- Developers: Generic Python developer BECOMES specialized ML Engineer

- Project Managers: Standard PM EVOLVES INTO Agile Coach
- Real Estate Agents: General agent BECOMES Luxury Property Specialist
- Teachers: Classroom teacher TRANSFORMS INTO EdTech Consultant
- Designers: Graphic designer EVOLVES INTO UX Architect

### üèóÔ∏è QUICK SETUP (2:30-3:30)
**[Screen: Show IDE options]**
*üìπ [See VIDEO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md ‚Üí Quick Setup Section Fix for recording details]*

"First, let's talk tools. You can use any IDE - VS Code, Cursor, WebStorm, any JetBrains product. I prefer VS Code - it's free and powerful."

**[Show download process]**
"Download VS Code from code.visualstudio.com. Works on Mac, Windows, and Linux."

**[Reference to Episode 01]**
"In Episode 01, I showed how to install Claude Code and set up this permissions bypass. Quick recap for new viewers:"

**[Terminal commands on screen]**
"For Mac/Linux users - add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc file:"

```bash
function claude() {
  command claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "$@"
}
source ~/.zshrc
```

**[Show Windows PowerShell]**
"Windows users - add this to your PowerShell profile:"

```powershell
function claude {
    & claude --dangerously-skip-permissions $args
}
```

**[Vocal instruction]**
"This saves hours by skipping permission prompts during development."

"Now organize your workspace with three simple folders:"

```bash
mkdir -p resumes/{templates,outputs,job-descriptions}
```

**[File structure visual with explanation]**
"Templates store your base resumes. Outputs hold tailored versions. Job descriptions save what worked. Simple system, massive results."

**[Bridge with energy]**
"Now comes the magic - building your AI resume expert..."

### ü§ñ CREATE YOUR AGENT (3:30-5:30)
**[Screen: Agent configuration file]**

**[Type out configuration with vocal guidance]**
```yaml
name: resume-fine-tuner
description: Tailors resumes to job descriptions
tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob
```

"This tells Claude Code what tools your agent can use. Read for analyzing job descriptions, Write for creating resumes, Grep and Glob for searching your experience."

**[Show experience database structure]**
"Now the critical part - feeding it your ENTIRE career. Watch how I structure this:"

```yaml
experience:
  # For Developers:

### üéØ LIVE DEMO (6:30-8:00)
**[Screen: Real job description from inbox]**

"Let me show you the power of this system. Here's a REAL job from my inbox this morning:"

```
Senior Full Stack Developer ‚Äì Healthcare
- Python, React, PostgreSQL
- HIPAA compliance required
- 7+ years experience minimum
- Remote, $180K-220K
```

**[Terminal command with vocal explanation]**
```bash
claude "resume-fine-tuner: Healthcare Full Stack role [paste JD]"
```

**[Vocal cue for demo]**
"Watch what happens in real-time. The agent extracts keywords, matches them to my experience, and generates a targeted resume."

**[Show 3-step process visualization with narration]**
"Step 1: EXTRACT - The agent identifies Python, React, Healthcare, HIPAA as critical keywords
Step 2: MATCH - It searches your experience file - not a complex database, just a simple text file with your career history
Step 3: GENERATE - Creates a perfectly tailored resume emphasizing healthcare experience"

**[Split screen comparison with vocal emphasis]**
"Look at the difference. The generic resume says 'Python developer with 10 years experience.'
The tailored one says 'Healthcare-focused full stack engineer with HIPAA-compliant system expertise.'

Which one gets the interview? Exactly."

**[Show actual metrics]**
"Processing time: 30 seconds. Response rate improvement: From 15 percent TO 45 percent. That's triple the interviews."

**[Excalidraw: Do's and Don'ts diagram]**
![[Excalidraw/Dos and donts.excalidraw|Dos and donts.excalidraw]]

**[Vocal walkthrough of do's and don'ts]**
"Critical rules for success:
DO use realistic metrics - say 'improved by 25 percent,' not '10x performance'
DO vary your language - mix 'built,' 'developed,' 'worked on'
DO save winning resumes - track what gets interviews

DON'T add fake skills - they'll test you
DON'T use robotic language - humans read these
DON'T send generic resumes - customization is everything"

**[Testimonial cards with real examples]**
"Real results from real users:
Software Developer: Three offers in two weeks after six months of silence
Marketing Manager: Doubled salary from 80K to 160K
Project Manager: Landed remote FAANG role after 50 rejections"

**[Bridge to opportunities]**

---

### üîç FIND OPPORTUNITIES (10:00-11:00)
**[Screen: Platform logos with stats]**

"Here's where the gold is hiding:"

**[Show each platform with tips]**
"LinkedIn: Turn on 'Open to Work' privately. Result? 50 plus messages per week.
AngelList or Wellfound: Startups offering equity. Filter by 'remote' and 'well-funded.'
Dice and Indeed: Volume strategy. Set up alerts for your keywords.
Your email spam folder: No joke - real opportunities get filtered. Check weekly."

**[Security alert with real example]**
"CRITICAL WARNING: I almost got phished by a fake Microsoft recruiter site. Perfect design, convincing domain. They wanted my LinkedIn password. NEVER enter credentials outside official sites. Verify recruiter emails with the actual company."

**[Bridge to closing]**
"You now have everything. The system, the tools, the sources. What you do next determines your future..."

### üé¨ CLOSING (11:00-12:30)
**[Screen: Split view - Two developers, different paths]**

"Picture this. Two professionals. Same experience. Different approaches.

Person A: Still manually editing resumes. Two hours per application. Generic content. 15 percent response rate.

Person B: Uses Claude Code agents. Two minutes per application. Perfectly tailored. 45 percent response rate.

Six months later: Person A is still searching. Person B has multiple offers and negotiating power."

**[YouTube Card @ 11:00: "Episode 01: Build Portfolio with AI" - top right]**

**[GitHub repo with live demo]**
"Everything you need is at github.com/anton-abyzov/ai-power
The complete agent code. Setup instructions. Real examples. Totally FREE.

Plus, if you missed Episode 1 on building portfolios with AI, that's there too."

**[Final powerful message with emphasis]**
"Here's the truth: In 2024 and beyond, there are only two types of professionals.

Those who USE AI to amplify their careers.
And those who get REPLACED by the first group.

You won't be replaced by AI.
You'll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI better than you.

The question isn't IF you should start.
It's whether you'll start TODAY, or after it's too late."
