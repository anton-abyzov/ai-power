## üé¨ Video Script (10-15 minutes)

---

### üî• HOOK (0:00-0:30)
**[Scene: Screen recording showing inbox with multiple job offers]**

"Getting 50+ recruiter messages a week? Backend today, frontend tomorrow, cloud architect next week? I'll show you how I use Claude Code to instantly tailor my resume for each opportunity - turning a 2-hour task into 2 minutes. And yes, this actually helped me land multiple 6-figure remote offers."

**[Quick montage: Show different job descriptions - Senior .NET Developer, Cloud Architect, ML Engineer]**

"Different roles need different resumes. Let me show you the AI-powered system I built that adapts my 18 years of experience to ANY job description."

---

### üìä THE PROBLEM (0:30-1:30)
**[Screen: Show typical developer's broad experience - multiple languages, clouds, frameworks]**

"Here's the reality for experienced developers:"

**[Show Excalidraw diagram: Broad Experience vs Focused JDs]**
![[Broad vs Focused.excalidraw]]

"You've worked with everything - C#, Python, JavaScript, Azure, AWS, Kubernetes... But that Senior .NET position? They want .NET expertise front and center. That ML role? They need to see your Python and TensorFlow first."

**[Show inbox with recruiter messages]**

"When you're getting dozens of opportunities, manually tailoring each resume is impossible. Too broad? You look unfocused. Too narrow? You miss opportunities."

**[Important message on screen]**
"Here's the truth: AI won't replace developers. But developers who don't use AI will be replaced by those who do. While everyone's panicking about AI taking jobs, there are actually MORE opportunities than ever - prompt engineering, AI integration, ML ops. Let me prove it..."

**[Screen: Scroll through dozens of unread LinkedIn messages and emails showing real jobs]**
"Look at my inbox - Senior Full Stack Healthcare, AI Architect, Data Engineers, GenAI Backend Engineer - all remote, all high-paying. The demand is exploding."

### üöÄ INTRODUCING CLAUDE CODE AGENTS (1:30-3:00)
**[Screen: Navigate to Claude Code docs]**

"In my previous episode, I showed how to create UI/UX agents for building portfolios. Today, we're taking it further - creating a resume fine-tuning agent that understands YOUR specific career."

**[Show Excalidraw: Agent Architecture Diagram]**

"Claude Code agents are custom AI assistants that follow your specific instructions. Think of them as specialized team members who know exactly how to present your experience."

**[Quick reference to previous video with overlay pointing to Episode 01]**

"If you haven't seen how we set up Obsidian and Claude Code, check out Episode 1 - link in the description."

---

### üèóÔ∏è SETTING UP THE WORKSPACE (3:00-4:00)
**[Screen recording: Terminal and file system]**

"Quick setup tip - to avoid permission prompts during development, add this to your shell config:"

**[Show terminal editing .zshrc]**
```bash
# For Mac/Linux - add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
function claude() {
  command claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "$@"
}

# Then reload: source ~/.zshrc
```

**[Security note on screen]**
"‚ö†Ô∏è Only for personal development - never use with sensitive data."

"Now let's organize our resume workspace:"

```bash
cd ~/Documents
mkdir -p resumes/{templates,outputs,job-descriptions}
```

**[Show file structure in VS Code or Obsidian]**

"We'll keep:
- Templates: Your base resume formats
- Outputs: Tailored versions for each application
- Job Descriptions: Save these for reference"

**[Important note on screen]**
"Quick note: We're using markdown for easy editing, but you can export to PDF, Word, or even LaTeX later."

---

### ü§ñ CREATING THE RESUME AGENT (4:00-6:30)
**[Screen: Open Claude Code configuration]**

"Now for the magic - let's create our resume fine-tuner agent:"

**[Type out the agent configuration, highlighting key sections]**

```yaml
name: resume-fine-tuner
description: Tailors resumes to specific job descriptions
tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob
```

**[Excalidraw: Show agent workflow - Input JD ‚Üí Extract Keywords ‚Üí Match Experience ‚Üí Generate Output]**

"The agent needs to:
1. Extract key requirements from the job description
2. Map them to your experience
3. Reorganize and emphasize relevant skills
4. Maintain authenticity - no fake experience"

**[Show the comprehensive experience database being added]**

"Here's the critical part - feed it ALL your experience upfront:"

```yaml
experience:
  - company: Carnival Corporation
    period: 2023-Present
    technologies: [Azure, .NET 8, Kafka, Kubernetes]
    achievements:
      - Built loyalty platform for 20M+ passengers
      - Reduced latency by 25% through optimization
  # ... more entries
```

**[Important callout]**
"Notice how I keep metrics modest and realistic? 25% improvement is believable. 10x performance? That screams AI-generated."

---

### üìù DEFINING YOUR EXPERIENCE (6:30-8:00)
**[Screen: Show sample experience file structure]**

"The key is organizing your experience by:
- Technologies used
- Quantifiable achievements
- Specific modules built
- Team sizes and scope"

**[Show Excalidraw: Experience Mapping Matrix]**

"Think of it as a database of your career that the AI can query:"

```markdown
## Project: Healthcare Data Platform
- **Company**: Olympus Corporation
- **Tech Stack**: FHIR, HL7, Azure Functions, .NET Core
- **Achievements**:
  - Processed 10M+ medical events daily
  - HIPAA compliant architecture

```

**[Pro tip overlay]**
