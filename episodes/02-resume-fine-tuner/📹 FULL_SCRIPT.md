**[Excalidraw: Do's and Don'ts diagram]**
![[Dos and Donts.excalidraw]]

**[Vocal walkthrough of do's and don'ts]**
"Critical rules for success:
DO use realistic metrics - say 'improved by 25 percent,' not '10x performance'
DO vary your language - mix 'built,' 'developed,' 'worked on'
DO save winning resumes - track what gets interviews

DON'T add fake skills - they'll test you
DON'T use robotic language - humans read these
DON'T send generic resumes - customization is everything"

Software Developer: Three offers in two weeks after six months of silence

### üîç FIND OPPORTUNITIES (10:00-11:00)
**[Screen: Platform logos with stats]**

"Here's where the gold is hiding:"

**[Show each platform with tips]**
"LinkedIn: Turn on 'Open to Work' privately. Result? 50 plus messages per week.
AngelList or Wellfound: Startups offering equity. Filter by 'remote' and 'well-funded.'
Dice and Indeed: Volume strategy. Set up alerts for your keywords.
Your email spam folder: No joke - real opportunities get filtered. Check weekly."

**[Security alert with real example]**
"CRITICAL WARNING: I almost got phished by a fake Microsoft recruiter site. Perfect design, convincing domain. They wanted my LinkedIn password. NEVER enter credentials outside official sites. Verify recruiter emails with the actual company."

**[Bridge to closing]**
"You now have everything. The system, the tools, the sources. What you do next determines your future..."

### üé¨ CLOSING (11:00-12:30)
**[Screen: Split view - Two developers, different paths]**

"Picture this. Two professionals. Same experience. Different approaches.

Person A: Still manually editing resumes. Two hours per application. Generic content. 15 percent response rate.

Person B: Uses Claude Code agents. Two minutes per application. Perfectly tailored. 45 percent response rate.

Six months later: Person A is still searching. Person B has multiple offers and negotiating power."

**[YouTube Card @ 11:00: "Episode 01: Build Portfolio with AI" - top right]**

**[GitHub repo with live demo]**
"Everything you need is at github.com/anton-abyzov/ai-power
The complete agent code. Setup instructions. Real examples. Totally FREE.

Plus, if you missed Episode 1 on building portfolios with AI, that's there too."

**[Final powerful message with emphasis]**
"Here's the truth: In 2024 and beyond, there are only two types of professionals.

Those who USE AI to amplify their careers.
And those who get REPLACED by the first group.

You won't be replaced by AI.
You'll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI better than you.

The question isn't IF you should start.
It's whether you'll start TODAY, or after it's too late."
