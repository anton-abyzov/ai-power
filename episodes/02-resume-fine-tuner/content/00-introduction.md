# Transform Your Resume in 2 Minutes

## The Modern Developer's Dilemma

Getting 50+ recruiter messages weekly? Each one wants something different:
- **Monday**: Senior .NET Developer focusing on microservices
- **Tuesday**: Cloud Architect with Azure expertise
- **Wednesday**: ML Engineer with Python and TensorFlow
- **Thursday**: Full-Stack Developer with React and Node.js
- **Friday**: DevOps Engineer with Kubernetes and Terraform

## The Old Way vs The Smart Way

### The Old Way (2+ Hours)
1. Read the entire job description
2. Manually identify key requirements
3. Rewrite your experience to match
4. Hope you didn't miss important keywords
5. Repeat for EVERY application

### The Smart Way (2 Minutes)
1. Copy the job description
2. Run Claude Code with your resume agent
3. Get a perfectly tailored resume
4. Apply with confidence
5. Move on to the next opportunity
