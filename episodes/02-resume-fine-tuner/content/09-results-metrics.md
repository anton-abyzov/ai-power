## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Over-Optimization
**Problem**: Resume has 100% keyword match, looks artificial
**Solution**: Aim for 85-90% match with natural integration

### Pitfall 2: Lost Personality
**Problem**: All resumes sound identical
**Solution**: Include 1-2 unique projects or interests

### Pitfall 3: Metric Inflation
**Problem**: Every achievement is "10x improvement"
**Solution**: Use realistic range (15-40% typically)

### Pitfall 4: Format Inconsistency
**Problem**: Different format for each application
**Solution**: Create 2-3 standard templates

### Pitfall 5: No Follow-Through
**Problem**: Great resume but generic cover letter
**Solution**: Use agent for cover letters too
