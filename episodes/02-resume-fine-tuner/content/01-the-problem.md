# The Developer's Resume Challenge

## Your Experience: Broad and Deep

As an experienced developer, you've likely worked with:

### Languages & Frameworks
- Backend: C#, Java, Python, Go, Node.js
- Frontend: React, Angular, Vue, Next.js
- Mobile: React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- AWS: EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, EKS
- Azure: Functions, AKS, Cosmos DB, Service Bus
- GCP: Cloud Run, BigQuery, GKE
- Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

### Data & AI/ML
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
- ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- Streaming: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Event Hubs

## The Job Market Reality

But each job posting is laser-focused:

### Example: Senior .NET Developer
> "Looking for expert in .NET 8, microservices, Azure Service Bus, Entity Framework Core..."

Your Python and Kubernetes experience? Irrelevant for this role.

### Example: ML Engineer
> "Required: Python, TensorFlow, MLflow, experience with large-scale model deployment..."

Your .NET expertise? Not what they're looking for.

## The Problems with Generic Resumes

### Too Broad = Unfocused
- Recruiters spend 6 seconds scanning
- Jack-of-all-trades impression
- Key skills get buried

### Too Narrow = Limited Opportunities
- Miss out on adjacent roles
- Can't pivot between markets
- Undervalue your versatility

### Manual Tailoring = Unsustainable
- 2+ hours per application
- Inconsistent quality
- Burnout from repetition
- Miss application deadlines

## The Solution: Intelligence Automation

What if you could:
1. **Keep** all your experience organized
2. **Automatically** identify what matters for each role
3. **Generate** perfectly tailored resumes in seconds
4. **Maintain** your authentic voice
5. **Track** what works best

That's exactly what we're building today.
