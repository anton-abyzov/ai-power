## Output Rules

```yaml
## Output Generation Rules

### Resume Structure:
1. **Contact Info**: Name, location, email, phone
2. **Summary**: 3-4 sentences, tailored to JD
3. **Experience**: Reverse chronological
4. **Skills**: Grouped by category
5. **Education**: Degree, institution, year

### Writing Style Guidelines:

#### DO Use:
- Mix of past and present tense naturally
- "Worked on", "Helped build", "Contributed to"
- Specific numbers: "roughly 25%", "~30ms", "around 10K"
- Real project names and technologies
- Team collaboration mentions

#### DON'T Use:
- Only "Led" or "Spearheaded"
- Perfect round numbers always
- 10x improvements (unless truly exceptional)
- Identical sentence structures
- AI-sounding phrases like "leveraged synergies"

### Metric Guidelines:
- Performance improvements: 15-30% typical
- Cost savings: 20-35% realistic
- Time reductions: 25-40% believable
- Uptime: 99.9% (not 99.999% unless proven)
- Team sizes: Actual numbers, not "large team"
```

## Filename Generation

Make the agent create smart filenames:

```yaml
## File Naming Convention

Extract and use:
1. Company name from JD or recruiter email
2. Position title (abbreviated)
3. Recruiter first name
4. Current month-year

Format: experience_[company]_[position]_[recruiter]_[date].md

Examples:
- experience_microsoft_senior_dotnet_john_2024-01.md
- experience_meta_ml_engineer_sarah_2024-02.md
- experience_aws_solutions_architect_client_2024-02.md
```

## Example Usage

Show the agent how to process a real JD:

```yaml
## Example Processing

### Input JD:
"Senior .NET Developer at Microsoft
Required: .NET 8, microservices, Azure, Entity Framework
Nice to have: Kubernetes, React
Team of 12 engineers building payment platform"

### Agent Analysis:
- Company: Microsoft
- Critical: .NET 8, microservices, Azure
- Important: Entity Framework, team experience
- Beneficial: Kubernetes, React
- Context: Payment systems, 12-person team

### Output Emphasis:
1. Lead with .NET 8 experience
2. Highlight Carnival payment gateway project
3. Mention team leadership (12 engineers)
4. Include Azure extensively
5. Add React from MUFG Bank project
6. Reference Kubernetes from Grenzebach
```

## Testing Your Agent

```bash
# Test with a sample JD
claude "Use the resume-fine-tuner agent to create a resume for this Senior Python Developer role at Spotify focusing on ML and data engineering"

# The agent should:
# 1. Identify Python and ML as critical
# 2. Pull relevant experience (ML projects)
# 3. Reorganize to lead with Python
# 4. Generate appropriate filename
# 5. Maintain natural language
```
