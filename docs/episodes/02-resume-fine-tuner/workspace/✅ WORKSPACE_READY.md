## 🔄 Iterative Refinement (Optional)

After generating, you can show:

```
@resume-fine-tuner

Make these adjustments:
1. Shorten professional summary to 2 sentences
2. Add more metrics to the microservices project
3. Emphasize leadership throughout

Keep everything else the same.
```

Claude will update the resume without starting over.
