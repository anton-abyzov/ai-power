- **Discover limitations** like cameo blocking via API
- **Fix broken workflows** live on camera
- **Integrate N8NMCP** with Claude Desktop

**Duration:** 46:47
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Prerequisites:** Basic programming knowledge, willingness to debug
**Note:** This shows the REAL work - bugs, edge cases, and all!

## üéØ WHAT YOU'LL BUILD

### SORA 2 Video Generation Workflow

**The ONE workflow built in this video:**

```
User Form Submission
       ‚Üì
   (Prompt, Orientation, Duration)
       ‚Üì
   HTTP POST to SORA 2 API
       ‚Üì
   Discord: "Video generation started"
       ‚Üì
   Wait 60 seconds
       ‚Üì
   Get Video Status
       ‚Üì
   Is Status = "completed"?
   ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is Status = "failed"?
   ‚îÇ        ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Discord: "Generation failed"
   ‚îÇ        ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Loop back to Wait
   ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Get Video Content
            ‚Üì
        Discord: "Video ready!" + metadata
```

**What it does:**
- Accepts video prompts via web form
- Generates videos automatically with SORA 2 API
- Handles completion, failure, and in-progress states
- Sends Discord notifications at each step
- Supports landscape/portrait orientation
- Configurable video duration (4, 8, 12 seconds)

**Real debugging covered:**
- [31:01] Rearranging broken workflow connections
- [36:42] Handling "failed" status from API
- [38:00] Fixing infinite loop in wait logic
- [39:38] Discovering cameo API blocks human faces
- [40:26] Discord message formatting errors

**Time to build:** ~90 minutes (with debugging)
**API cost per video:** $0.40-$1.20 for 4-12 second videos

## üöÄ QUICK START

### Step 1: Access SORA 2 (Choose Your Method)

**Method 1: iOS App** (Easiest for testing)
- Download "Sora by OpenAI" from App Store
- Available in US & Canada (VPN works for others)
- Requires invite OR ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo)

**Method 2: Web Interface** (Shown in video)
- Visit: https://sora.gpt.com
- Same features as iOS
- Works in any browser

**Method 3: API** (For automation - shown in video)
- Requires OpenAI API key
- Organization verification required (driver's license, 1-2 days)
- **EXPENSIVE:** $0.10-$0.50 per second of video
- Set spending limits BEFORE using!

**ChatGPT Pricing Options:**
- **Plus ($20/mo):** 30 videos/day, up to 10 seconds, has watermark
- **Pro ($200/mo):** 500 videos/month, up to 20 seconds, no watermark

---

### Step 2: Install N8N Locally (Free)

**What I use in the video:**

```bash
# Install Node.js 22+ first (if needed)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 22
nvm use 22

# Install and run N8N
npx n8n

# Access at: http://localhost:5678
```

**First time:**
- Create username and password
- Start building workflows

**Alternative options:**
- N8N Cloud: $20/month (easier, no setup)
- Docker: `docker run -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n`

---

### Step 3: Build the Workflow (Follow Video)

**Key workflow sections shown:**

1. **[19:27] Form submission trigger** - Create input form for prompts
2. **[23:26] HTTP POST to SORA 2 API** - Send video generation request
3. **[24:30] Wait node** - Pause while video generates
4. **[24:46] Get video status** - Check if completed/failed/in-progress
5. **[27:31] If conditions** - Branch logic for different statuses
6. **[27:48] Get video content** - Retrieve generated video
7. **[30:51] Discord webhooks** - Notifications at each step

**Debugging moments you'll see:**
- [31:01] Fixing broken connections
- [36:42] Handling failed videos
- [38:06] Fixing infinite loops
- [39:38] API cameo limitation discovered
- [40:40] Discord message formatting

---

### Step 4: Test with Real Prompts

**Example from video ([34:07]):**

```
[0-3 seconds] Extreme close-up of professional dive helmet with LED lights
[3-6 seconds] Camera pulls back revealing professional deep sea diving suit
[6-9 seconds] Wide shot showing diver suspended in deep ocean void
[9-12 seconds] Camera orbits showing diver ascending slowly

Technical: Professional atmospheric video, cinematic lighting
Branding: Subtle "EasyChamp" watermark
```

**Simpler version that works:**

```
Professional deep sea diver in full diving suit, suspended in deep ocean,
surrounded by darkness, LED helmet lights glowing, camera slowly orbiting,
cinematic underwater photography, 4K quality
```

**Critical lesson from video:** Don't use cameo/human face references via API - they get blocked by moderation!

## üîß N8N BASICS (From Video)

**What is N8N?** ([15:08])
- Fair code workflow automation
- Like Zapier but self-hosted
- Your data, your server
- FREE forever (self-hosted)
- 400+ integrations
- Visual workflow builder

**Three ways to install:** ([16:51])
1. **Local** (what I use) - FREE, npm/npx
2. **Docker** - Isolated, portable
3. **N8N Cloud** - $20/month, no setup

**Key concepts shown:**
- **Nodes:** Individual steps (HTTP Request, Wait, If, Discord)
- **Triggers:** What starts the workflow (Manual, Form, Webhook)
- **Connections:** How nodes pass data
- **Credentials:** Secure API key storage
- **Executions:** Workflow run history

---

## üêõ REAL DEBUGGING FROM VIDEO

### Issue 1: Policy Violation ([12:50])
**Problem:** Video request rejected for "potential fraud/scam"
**Solution:** Remove specific person names, use generic descriptions
**Lesson:** SORA blocks brand names and public figures

### Issue 2: Infinite Loop ([36:42])
**Problem:** Workflow keeps waiting forever, never completes
**Solution:** Add "failed" status check before looping back to wait
**Lesson:** Always handle failure states, not just success

### Issue 3: Cameo API Blocking ([39:32])
**Problem:** API blocks human face references (cameo) even with verification
**Solution:** Use generic descriptions ("professional diver" instead of "Anton Abyzov")
**Lesson:** Cameo via API = moderation blocked

### Issue 4: Discord Formatting ([40:26])
**Problem:** Complex prompts break Discord message formatting
**Solution:** Send simple metadata instead of full prompt text
**Lesson:** Sanitize data before sending to external APIs

## ü§ñ N8NMCP INTEGRATION ([42:18])

**What is N8NMCP?**
- Model Context Protocol server for N8N
- Lets Claude Desktop control N8N workflows
- Generate workflows with natural language

**Setup steps shown:**
1. Install N8NMCP from GitHub
2. Add to Claude Desktop config
3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. Ask Claude: "Build a workflow that sends Discord test message on manual trigger"
5. Import generated JSON into N8N
6. Test and fix any issues

**Result:** Working workflow generated by Claude in seconds!

## üö® CRITICAL WARNINGS

### API Key Security
- Never expose OpenAI API keys in public code
- Never commit keys to GitHub
- Use N8N credentials system (encrypted)
- One leaked key = unlimited charges

### Cost Management
- Set hard spending limits BEFORE testing
- Test prompts in iOS/Web app first (cheaper)
- Start with 4-second videos (cheaper)
- Monitor OpenAI dashboard daily

### Organization Verification
- Required for SORA 2 API access
- Upload government ID (driver's license works)
- Takes 1-2 business days
- Without verification = no API access

### Cameo Limitation
- Human face references blocked via API
- Works in iOS/Web app
- Doesn't work in API automation
- Use generic descriptions instead

## üé¨ FINAL WORDS

This isn't a perfect tutorial. It's a REAL build.

You'll see me:
- Make mistakes
- Debug live
- Discover limitations
- Rearrange workflows
- Fix formatting issues
- Learn as I go

**That's the point.**

Real automation has bugs. Real APIs fail. Real workflows need iteration.

If you want a polished demo, this isn't it.

If you want to learn how automation ACTUALLY works - including the messy parts - this is for you.

**46 minutes of real work. No shortcuts. No hiding mistakes.**

Let's build.
