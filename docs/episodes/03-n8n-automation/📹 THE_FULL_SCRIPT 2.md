### Part 6: SORA 2 DETAILED PRICING & WARNINGS (95 seconds)

**üìπ SCREEN: Sora 2 Official Page + Mobile App**

**Open:** https://sora.com and App Store page

**Voiceover:**
```




**üåç IMPORTANT: Outside US/Canada?**

Let's look at the mobile iOS Sora 2 application, which is officially available in US and Canada only. But the reality is that many international users access it with the help of VPN tools.

[Show iPhone screen mirrored to OBS]

**üì± iOS App Demo - Full Walkthrough:**

I'll demonstrate the iOS app by connecting my iPhone to show the mobile experience.

[Show iOS home screen ‚Üí Open Sora app]

If you've got an invite and logged in with your ChatGPT account, here's what you see:

[Show app loading ‚Üí Main screen appears]

**Quick note:** While recording this, I discovered the Sora mobile app has internet connectivity issues when the iPhone is connected via cable to a Mac recording through QuickTime. By the way, Sora 2 just became the #1 iOS app by downloads in the US! So I'll switch to the web version at sora.com - it has exactly the same functionality, though it's noticeably slower and can make the computer sluggish. I usually close and reopen it every minute or so, especially once I see "Added to queue" after submitting a video prompt.

**Main Feed (Home Page):**

[Show scrolling through feed]

This is the main feed - like Instagram or TikTok. Community videos. Trending prompts. Sora 2 showcases.

Scroll through, like and follow creators. See what others are creating. Get inspired.

Each video shows the prompt used. Tap to see details.

Filter at the top to find specific ones, e.g. for sport


[Tap on a video to show details]

**Cameo Feature - THIS IS POWERFUL:**

[Tap "Create" ‚Üí "Upload Cameo"]

Cameo. This is where it gets personal.

Upload a short video of yourself. Sora 2 learns your appearance.



[Show upload interface]

Once uploaded, reference yourself in prompts with @aabyzov tag.

[Type prompt in text field]

Sora 2 generates YOU in the video. Your face. Your likeness. Cinematic quality.

[Show generation starting]

**Creating a Video:**

[Show create interface]

Let me create a video right now with this prompt:

Choose landscape of portrait

"@sama welcomes @aabyzov as the new CTO of the OpenAI company in their office, modern tech office, San Francisco skyline visible through windows, professional business attire, handshake, celebration, cinematic lighting. And just to make it more interesting add image - logo of my company easychamp - use this image somewhere related to me"

[Show loading spinner]

**While Generating - Exploring Drafts:**

[Navigate to Drafts tab]

[Show draft videos]

**Remix Feature:**

Remix. THIS is genius.

Take any video you've created. Add new details to the original prompt.

## üõ†Ô∏è INSTALLATION (2:30-3:30)

### Part 1: Installation Options (60 seconds)

**üìπ SCREEN: Terminal + N8N Documentation**

**Show three options clearly:**

**Voiceover:**
```
"Three ways to run N8N: standalone local install, Docker, or cloud.

[Show terminal]

Option 1: Standalone local install.
This is what I'm using today. Free, simple, perfect for learning.

Requirements: Node.js 18 or higher. That's it.

One command:
```

**On screen, show commands:**

**Standalone Local Install (Recommended for Tutorial):**
```bash
# Install N8N globally with npm
npm install -g n8n

# Start N8N
n8n start

# Access at: http://localhost:5678
```

**Voiceover continues:**
```
"npm install -g n8n. Installs globally to your system.

n8n start. Launches N8N on localhost port 5678.

[Show browser opening to localhost:5678]

Free forever. Your data in ~/.n8n folder. Full control.

To stop: Ctrl+C. To restart: n8n start.

Simple.

[Show second option]

Option 2: Docker. For those who love containers.
```

**Docker (Self-Hosted):**
```bash
# Install N8N with Docker (one command)
docker run -d \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n

# Access at: http://localhost:5678
```

**Voiceover continues:**
```
"Docker: One command. Isolated environment. Same localhost:5678.

Great if you already use Docker. Portable, easy to reset.

[Show third option]

Option 3: Cloud. Managed hosting.
```

**Cloud (Easiest, but costs money):**
```
1. Visit: https://n8n.cloud
2. Sign up (email + password)
3. Create first workflow
4. $20/month after free trial
```

**Voiceover continues:**
```
"Cloud: Visit n8n.cloud. Sign up. No installation. Hosted for you.

Free trial, then $20/month. Great for teams or if you don't want to manage servers.

[Pause]

For this tutorial, I'm using standalone local install - Option 1.
It's free, it's simple, and you can see exactly how N8N works.

Once you're comfortable, switch to cloud or Docker if you prefer.

[Show N8N starting up in terminal]

npm install -g n8n... done.
n8n start... running.
Open browser to localhost:5678.

Let me show you the dashboard."
```

**Editing Notes:**
- Show all three commands clearly (pause 2-3 seconds each)
- Add "I'm using Standalone Install" badge
- Highlight that it's FREE

```

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:**

### Part 2: Build the Workflow (150 seconds)

**üìπ SCREEN: N8N - Live Build (UNCUT)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE WE START - CRITICAL API KEY SETUP:**

Before building the workflow, you need an OpenAI API key with Sora access. Let me show you how.

**Getting Your OpenAI API Key (Show on screen):**

1. **Navigate to:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Sign in** with your OpenAI/ChatGPT account
3. **Click "Create new secret key"**
   - Name it: "n8n-sora-automation"
   - Permissions: "All" (or select specific)
   - **CRITICAL:** Copy the key immediately - you won't see it again!
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Organization Verification Required:**
   - For Sora API access, you need organization verification
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general
   - Click "Verify Organization"
   - Upload state-issued ID (driver's license, passport)
   - Verification takes 1-2 business days
   - Without this, Sora API requests will fail
5. **Set Billing Limits:**
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
   - Set monthly budget cap (recommend $50 to start)
   - Sora costs $0.10-$0.50 per second
   - Safety first - prevent unexpected charges!

**Security Note (emphasize this):**
- Treat API keys like passwords
- NEVER share them publicly
- NEVER commit them to GitHub
- Use n8n credentials storage
- I'm deleting this key immediately after recording

---

**NOW LET'S BUILD THE WORKFLOW:**

**Actions (show every step):**

1. **Add Manual Trigger Node:**
   - Click "+" on canvas
   - Search "Manual Trigger"
   - Select "Manual Trigger"
   - Add form fields:
     - Field 1: "prompt" (Text, multiline) ‚Üê **NOTE: "prompt" not "videoPrompt"**
     - Field 2: "duration" (Dropdown options: "4", "8", "12")
     - Field 3: "size" (Dropdown: "1280x720", "720x1280")
   - This lets us trigger workflow manually with custom input

2. **Add HTTP Request Node #1 - Create Video (Sora 2 API):**

```
"Before we build, you NEED an OpenAI API key with Sora access.

[Show platform.openai.com/api-keys]

Go to platform.openai.com/api-keys. Create new secret key.

[Show creating key]

Name it 'n8n-sora-automation'. Copy immediately - you won't see it again.

[Show organization verification screen]

CRITICAL: Organization verification required.

Upload your state-issued ID - driver's license or passport.
Takes 1-2 business days. Without this, Sora API won't work.

[Show billing limits]

Set billing limits. I recommend $50/month to start.
Sora costs $0.10-$0.50 per second. Safety first.

[Emphasize]

IMPORTANT: I'm deleting this key right after recording.
Never share API keys. Treat them like passwords.

[Return to N8N]

NOW let's build.

Step 1: Manual Trigger. This starts everything.

[Add Manual Trigger node]

Three form fields:
- 'prompt' - NOTE: 'prompt' not 'videoPrompt'. That's the official API parameter.
- 'duration' - Dropdown: 4, 8, or 12 seconds
- 'size' - Resolution: 1280x720 or 720x1280

[Show form configuration]

Simple. Clean. Ready.

Step 2: HTTP Request #1. Create the video.

[Add HTTP Request node]

POST to api.openai.com/v1/videos

[Show authentication setup]

Click 'Add Credential'. Header Auth.
Name: Authorization. Value: Bearer [paste your API key].

N8N encrypts this. Secure storage.

[Configure body]

JSON body:
- model: 'sora-2'
- prompt: pulls from manual trigger
- seconds: duration from dropdown
- size: resolution from dropdown

[Show JSON configuration]

This is the official Sora API structure. Documented by OpenAI.

Step 3: Extract Video ID.

[Add Code node]

JavaScript extracts the video ID from API response.
Also builds the status check URL.

[Show code]

Simple. Clean. Returns structured data.

Step 4: Discord notification #1. Generation started.

[Add Discord webhook]

Open Discord. Go to your server. My server: anton-abyzov.
Channel: #sora-videos.

[Show Discord webhook creation]

Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí New Webhook.
Name: 'N8N Sora Bot'. Copy URL.

[Paste webhook in N8N]

Message shows: Prompt, Video ID, Status.

[Show Discord message template]

This notifies me immediately. Generation started. ID tracked.

Step 5: Wait 60 seconds.

[Add Wait node]

Videos take 2-5 minutes to generate.
We wait 1 minute, then check status.

Step 6: HTTP Request #2. Check status.

[Add HTTP Request node]

GET request to /v1/videos/{videoId}

[Show configuration]

Uses same authentication. Same API key.
URL comes from our Code node - already formatted.

Step 7: Check if complete.

[Add Code node]

JavaScript checks status.
If 'completed' - return true with video URL.
If still processing - return false.

[Show code]

This decision node controls our flow.

Step 8: IF node. Route based on status.

[Add IF node]

If ready == true: go to 'Video Ready' notification.
If ready == false: go to 'Still Processing' notification.

[Show IF configuration]

This splits our workflow into two paths.

Step 9 & 10: Discord notifications.

[Add two Discord webhooks]

Path 1: 'Video Ready' - Shows download link and API URL.
Path 2: 'Still Processing' - Tells me to check manually.

[Show both message templates]

One workflow. Two outcomes. Smart automation.

[Pause]

NOW let's test it. LIVE. REAL API CALL.

[Click Execute Workflow]

Enter prompt: Underwater recording studio. @aabyzov with headphones.
Coral reef through glass. Modern mixing console glowing.
30 feet below ocean. Cinematic 4K.

Duration: 8 seconds.
Size: 1280x720.

[Click Run Workflow]

Watch it execute. Every node. Live.

[Show HTTP Request #1 running]

POST to Sora API... Request sent.

[Show API response]

Response received! Video ID: [shows ID]. Status: queued.

[Show Discord app]

Discord notification. Immediately. Real-time.

[Show Discord message appearing]

'Video generation started. Video ID: xyz. Status: queued.'

[Show Wait node]

60 second wait. Timer counting down.

[Fast forward or time-lapse the wait]

Wait complete. Now checking status.

[Show HTTP Request #2 running]

GET request to check status... Response received.

[Show status response]

Status: [shows status - could be 'in_progress' or 'completed']

[Show IF node routing]

IF node evaluates... Routes to [true/false path].

[Show final Discord notification]

Final Discord message:

[If completed]
'Video completed! Go to sora.com ‚Üí Drafts ‚Üí Video ID xyz. Download there.'

[If still processing]
'Still processing. Check sora.com manually or run again in 1 minute.'

[Show sora.com in browser]

Go to sora.com. Check Drafts tab. There's our video!

[Show video playing]

THERE. Underwater recording studio. Coral reef. Glass walls.
Producer creating music. Exactly as prompted.

[Pause]

That's automation.

Prompt ‚Üí API ‚Üí Discord notification ‚Üí Video link.

No manual clicking through Sora's UI.
Just run the workflow. Get notified. Download your video.

[Emphasize]

This workflow? Saves HOURS.

Content creators: Generate 10 videos overnight.
Marketers: Automated video assets.
Creators: Batch production while you sleep.

First workflow complete. Sora 2 on demand. Automated.

**If you haven't subscribed yet** - do it now.

The next workflows? Even more powerful."

Seamless transition at 5 seconds: @aabyzov now paragliding/parachuting with a powered paraplane rig, soaring high above a packed football stadium with 100,000+ fans (resembling Camp Nou or Wembley). Golden hour lighting, sunset casting orange glow. Stadium lights on, crowd visible.

@aabyzov performs controlled descent toward center field, spiraling down gracefully. Crowd notices and begins cheering, phones recording. @aabyzov lands smoothly on the grass in the center circle, detaches from paraplane harness, raises both arms in triumphant victory pose. Crowd erupts, confetti cannons fire from sidelines, stadium announcer voice audible.

Drone shot pulls back showing @aabyzov tiny figure surrounded by 100,000 fans on their feet, entire stadium lit up, massive scale. Epic orchestral music crescendo.

Cinematic, professional action sports cinematography. Realistic physics. Emotional peak. MEGA VIRAL potential.
