Day 1 - Burj Khalifa:
"I just climbed the world's tallest building and jumped 1,200 feet.

Well, sort of.

This is Sora 2 by @OpenAI - and it's about to change everything.

Here's what I learned building 40 hours of automation in one week 🧵

[Attach Burj Khalifa video]

1/ Three years ago I couldn't code. Today I automate everything.

The secret? AI agents like Claude Code + workflow tools like N8N.

This video took 2 seconds to generate. The automation I built saves 40 hours/week.

2/ Here's the stack I used:
• N8N for workflows
• Claude Sonnet 4.5 for AI logic
• Sora 2 for video generation
• GitHub for documentation

All open source. All free to start.

Full tutorial: [YouTube link]

3/ The craziest part? I'm not special.

Anyone can do this. You just need:
- Curiosity
- 10 hours to learn
- Willingness to experiment

I built @easychamp using these same tools.

Now we're backed by Sam Altman and processing 1M+ data points/day.

4/ Sora 2 isn't perfect. But it's good enough to be dangerous.

Cost: ~$0.10-0.50/second
Quality: Better than most stock footage
Speed: 2 minutes per video

This changes content creation forever.

5/ What are you going to build with this?

Post 1 - Burj Khalifa + Automation Story:
"Three years ago, I spent 60 hours/week on repetitive tasks.

Today, I spend 4 hours/week. The other 56? Automated.

Here's what changed 👇

[Attach Burj Khalifa video - landscape]

In 2022, I was drowning in:
• Email sorting (10 hours/week)
• Content creation (15 hours/week)
• Data entry (8 hours/week)
• Social media posting (5 hours/week)

I was working harder, not smarter.

Then I discovered N8N workflow automation + Claude AI.

The result? 40 hours saved. Every. Single. Week.

Here's my exact stack:
✅ N8N for workflow automation (free, open source)
✅ Claude Sonnet 4.5 for AI intelligence
✅ Sora 2 for video generation (this video cost $0.50)
✅ GitHub for documentation

The video you just watched? Generated in 2 minutes.
The automation workflows? Built in 3 days.
The time saved? Priceless.

I used these same principles to build EasyChamp, now serving 10,000+ companies with competitive intelligence.

The future isn't about working more hours.
It's about building systems that work for you.

What task would you automate first if you had the tools?

**LinkedIn Video Post Best Practices:**
- **Attach video directly to LinkedIn** (better reach than external links)
- **First 2 lines are critical** (visible before "see more")
- **3-5 hashtags max** (LinkedIn punishes over-tagging)
- **Tag relevant people/companies:** @OpenAI @Anthropic
- **Post timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8:00 AM EST or 12:00 PM EST

**Post 2 - UEFA Champions League + Team Building:**
```
"Liverpool just won the Champions League.

But the real victory? The team that got them there.

Building EasyChamp taught me the same lesson 👇

[Attach UEFA video]

Three years ago, I was a solo founder trying to do everything:
❌ Product development
❌ Marketing
❌ Sales
❌ Customer support
❌ Finance

I was the goalkeeper, striker, defender, and coach.

Sound familiar?

Today, EasyChamp has a team of 47. We just raised $25M.

But here's what I learned:

1️⃣ You can't win alone
No solo founder has ever built a unicorn. You need a team.

2️⃣ Hire for strengths, not to fill gaps
I hired people better than me in every function. That's the only way to scale.

3️⃣ Systems > Heroes
One person working 80 hours/week isn't sustainable. Build systems that work without you.

4️⃣ Celebrate wins together
Every milestone - product launch, first customer, funding round - celebrate as a team.

The automation tools I built (N8N + Claude AI) freed me to focus on team building.

That's the real leverage.

What's your biggest challenge building a team?

**Post 3 - SpaceX + Vision:**
```
"When SpaceX launched Starship, everyone said it was impossible.

Now they're landing rockets on drone ships.

This is what audacious goals look like 👇

[Attach SpaceX video]

At EasyChamp, we set an impossible goal:

"Track every competitor in real-time. For every company. Everywhere."

People laughed. Investors passed. Competitors dismissed us.

Three years later:
✅ 10,000+ companies using our platform
✅ 1M+ competitors tracked daily
✅ $25M Series A from Sam Altman
✅ 47 team members across 12 countries

The lesson?

Set goals so big they scare you.

Most founders underestimate what's possible in 5 years.
And overestimate what's possible in 1 year.

We aimed for the moon. We're on our way to Mars.

What's your company's moonshot goal?

### **6. FACEBOOK (Personal Profile + Business Page)**

**Strategy:** Older demographic, longer-form content, community building

**Content Plan:**
- **Weekly posts with video, focus on storytelling and inspiration**

**Facebook Post Template:**
```
Personal Story Post:
"I'm standing 1,200 feet above Dubai. One jump separates me from the impossible.

This video was created with AI in 2 minutes. But the journey to this moment took 3 years.

Let me tell you the story 👇

[Attach Burj Khalifa video]

In 2022, I was working 60-hour weeks building EasyChamp. Exhausted. Burnt out. Barely seeing my family.

Then I discovered automation.

N8N workflows. Claude AI. Tools that could do in seconds what took me hours.

I automated:
✅ Email management (saved 10 hours/week)
✅ Content creation (saved 15 hours/week)
✅ Data processing (saved 8 hours/week)
✅ Social media (saved 5 hours/week)

Total: 38 hours per week back in my life.

That time went to:
• Building a better product
• Growing our team (now 47 people!)
• Spending time with my wife [tag]
• Raising $25M from Sam Altman

The video you're watching? Made with Sora 2 AI. Cost: $0.50. Time: 2 minutes.

The lesson?

Technology isn't replacing us. It's freeing us to be more human.

I work 4 hours/week on repetitive tasks now. The rest? Strategy. People. Vision.

That's the future of work.

If you could automate one thing in your life, what would it be?

### **7. TELEGRAM (Personal Channel + EasyChamp Channel)**

**Strategy:** Early access hub, behind-the-scenes, exclusive content with watermarked Sora 2 videos + links to main YouTube

#### **Watermark Strategy Decision:**

**RECOMMENDATION: Keep Sora 2 watermarks for social media, remove for your main YouTube videos**

**Why:**
1. **Credibility boost:** Sora 2 watermark = "This is cutting-edge AI" = drives curiosity
2. **Free advertising:** People will search "Sora 2" after seeing your videos
3. **Authenticity:** Transparent about using AI builds trust
4. **Virality:** "Made with Sora 2" becomes part of the hook
5. **No copyright issues:** Watermark proves it's your generated content

**When to REMOVE watermarks:**
- Main YouTube tutorial video (looks more professional)
- EasyChamp YouTube channel (brand focus, not tool focus)
- Client/business presentations
- When you want viewer to focus on content, not the tool

**When to KEEP watermarks:**
- TikTok, Instagram Reels, Shorts (helps with "How did you make this?" engagement)
- X/Twitter (tech community appreciates the transparency)
- LinkedIn (shows you're early adopter of new tech)
- Telegram/Discord (community wants to know the process)

**Ideal Setup:**
- **Download 2 versions from Sora 2:**
  - Version 1: With Sora 2 watermark (for social media - TikTok, IG, X)
  - Version 2: Without watermark (for professional use - main YouTube, client presentations)

#### **Personal Telegram Channel Strategy:**

**Content Plan:**
- **Early access to videos 2-4 hours before other platforms**
- **Behind-the-scenes prompts and generation process**
- **Raw, unfiltered updates**

**3-Day Blitz Telegram Schedule:**

**Day 1 (Sunday Oct 13):**

**6:00 AM EST (3 hours before public post):**
```
🔥 EARLY ACCESS - Telegram Only

Dropping Carnegie Hall video in 3 hours on TikTok/IG.

You see it first.

[Attach Carnegie Hall video - WITH watermark]

📝 Actual Sora 2 Prompt:
"@aabyzov performing at Carnegie Hall, grand piano on stage, sold-out crowd, spotlight, standing ovation. Made in 2 minutes. Cost: $0.50"

⚡ Full batch drops over next 3 days.
⚡ YouTube tutorial coming next week.

Drop a 🎹 if you want more prompts.
```

**12:00 PM EST (Mid-day update):**
```
Update: Carnegie Hall video just crossed 5,000 views in 3 hours.

Sam Altman meeting video drops at 3 PM.

Here's the Sora 2 prompt I used:

"@aabyzov meeting with @sama at OpenAI office, discussing EasyChamp, handshake, modern office, San Francisco skyline through windows, professional business meeting."

This one took 4 attempts. First 3 had weird hand gestures.

Learnings:
✅ Simple descriptions work best
✅ Mention real brands (OpenAI) for authenticity
✅ Keep it under 50 words

Full prompt collection: [GitHub link when ready]
```

**5:00 PM EST (Evening preview):**
```
Tonight's video: Underwater Recording Studio 🎙️🌊

This is the weirdest one yet.

[Attach video preview or still frame]

Prompt: "@aabyzov recording podcast 20 feet underwater in transparent acrylic cube, fish swimming past, microphone setup, Caribbean blue water."

Goes live on TikTok/IG at 7 PM.

Want to see how it performs? I'll share analytics tomorrow morning.

This community gets all the behind-the-scenes 👇
```

**Day 2-3:** Continue same pattern (early access + prompts + analytics updates)

#### **Personal Telegram vs Other Platforms:**

| Platform | Content Type | Timing | Watermark? |
|----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Telegram Personal** | Early access + prompts + analytics | 2-4 hours before public | WITH (shows process) |
| **TikTok/IG/Shorts** | Public viral content | Scheduled times | WITH (builds credibility) |
| **YouTube Main** | Full tutorial (future) | Sunday Oct 20 | WITHOUT (professional) |
| **Discord** | Community discussion | After Telegram, before public | WITH (tech community) |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional storytelling | Public schedule | WITH (early adopter signal) |
| **X/Twitter** | Tech community | Public schedule | WITH (transparency) |

#### **EasyChamp Telegram Channel Strategy:**

**Content Plan:**
- **EasyChamp-specific videos go to easychamp YouTube FIRST (no watermark)**
- **Then share YouTube link in Telegram (not raw video)**
- **This drives YouTube views for easychamp channel**

**Example Post:**
```
📢 EasyChamp Update: 1,500+ Users Milestone

We just crossed 1,500 companies tracking competitors with our platform.

Here's a quick video we made with AI to celebrate:

🎥 Watch on YouTube: [easychamp YouTube link]

This video shows what's possible when you combine:
✅ Real-time data
✅ AI-powered insights
✅ Competition intelligence

We made this with Sora 2 AI in 2 minutes.

Imagine what we can do with your competitor data.

Try EasyChamp: easychamp.com
```

**Why this approach:**
- Drives YouTube views (helps algorithm)
- Keeps Telegram focused on linking to assets, not hosting everything
- YouTube is better archive/discovery than Telegram
- Clean separation: Telegram = announcement hub, YouTube = content hub

#### **Discord Strategy (Personal Server):**

**Content Plan:**
- **Share Telegram early access content 1 hour later**
- **Create discussion threads for each video**
- **Let community vote on which videos to prioritize**

**Example Discord Flow:**

**#announcements channel:**

## 🎯 WATERMARK DECISION MATRIX

### **Keep Sora 2 Watermark:**
✅ **TikTok** - "Made with Sora 2" becomes conversation starter
✅ **Instagram Reels** - Transparency = authenticity = trust
✅ **YouTube Shorts** - Tech-savvy audience appreciates the tool
✅ **X/Twitter** - Tech community wants to know the process
✅ **LinkedIn** - Shows you're early adopter (competitive advantage signal)
✅ **Telegram** - Community wants behind-the-scenes
✅ **Discord** - Same as Telegram
✅ **Facebook** - Older demographic curious about "how it's made"

**Total: Keep watermark for 8/9 platforms**

### **Remove Watermark:**
✅ **YouTube Main Video** (future tutorial) - Professional, polished, not about the tool
✅ **EasyChamp YouTube Channel** - Brand-focused, not tool-focused
✅ **Client Presentations** - Business context, tool irrelevant
✅ **Sales Materials** - Focus on message, not how it was made

**Total: Remove for professional/business contexts only**

---

## 💡 STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OF KEEPING WATERMARK

1. **Free Sora 2 Advertising Works Both Ways:**
   - People search "Sora 2" → Find your videos → Subscribe
   - Your videos show up in "Sora 2 examples" searches
   - OpenAI may retweet/share (free exposure)

2. **Engagement Boost:**
   - Comments asking "What is Sora 2?" = algorithm signal
   - Responses drive more engagement
   - Creates natural conversation in comments

3. **Credibility:**
   - "I'm not hiding that this is AI" = trustworthy
   - Shows you're early adopter = authority
   - Differentiates from creators using AI secretly

4. **Tutorial Setup:**
   - Every watermarked video is a teaser for your YouTube tutorial
   - "Learn how I made this" becomes natural CTA
   - Builds anticipation for full reveal

5. **Content Protection:**
   - Watermark proves YOU generated it (not stolen)
   - Harder for others to repost as their own
   - Timestamp of when video was created

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD STRATEGY

**From Sora 2, download:**

1. **WITH watermark** (primary version):
   - Use for: TikTok, IG, Shorts, X, LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, Facebook
   - Save as: `carnegie-hall-watermark.mp4`

2. **WITHOUT watermark** (professional version):
   - Use for: Main YouTube tutorial, easychamp YouTube, presentations
   - Save as: `carnegie-hall-clean.mp4`

**Folder structure:**
```
/Sora2-Batch1/
  /watermarked/
    - carnegie-hall.mp4
    - sam-altman.mp4
    - underwater.mp4
    - spacex.mp4
    - etc.
  /clean/
    - carnegie-hall-clean.mp4
    - sam-altman-clean.mp4
    - etc.
  /portrait-crops/
    - carnegie-hall-9x16.mp4
    - etc.
```

---

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Keep the Sora 2 watermarks for your 3-day blitz.**

It's a feature, not a bug. The watermark:
- Builds credibility
- Drives curiosity
- Increases engagement
- Sets up your tutorial
- Protects your content

**Only use clean versions for:**
- EasyChamp YouTube channel (business-focused)
- Future main tutorial (once you've taught them HOW, show them polished results)

**The watermark IS your viral hook.** "Wait, AI made this??" is exactly the reaction you want.

Ready to download and post tomorrow morning? 🚀

### **8. TIKTOK (@antonabyzov Personal + @easychamp Brand)**

**Strategy:** Maximum virality, short-form vertical content, algorithm-driven discovery, younger demographic (Gen Z/Millennial)

**Why TikTok Matters:**
- 1.5B+ monthly active users
- Highest engagement rate of any platform (5-10%)
- Discovery algorithm can make unknown creators go viral overnight
- Perfect for portrait videos (9:16 native)
- Cross-posting to Instagram Reels often less effective than TikTok-native content

#### **Personal Account (@antonabyzov):**

**Content Plan:**
- **Daily TikToks for 10 days straight** (algorithm rewards consistency)

**TikTok Video Series:**

**Day 1 - Hotel Pool Jump (Portrait):**
```

- **Primary:** 6:00-9:00 PM EST (peak evening scrolling)
- **Secondary:** 12:00-1:00 PM EST (lunch break)
- **Alternative:** 7:00-9:00 AM EST (morning commute)

**TikTok-Specific Scheduling (October 13-22, 2025):**
- Sun Oct 13: 7:00 PM - Hotel Pool Jump (launch with bang)
- Mon Oct 14: 6:00 PM - Burj Khalifa

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- 3-4 broad hashtags: #Entrepreneur #AI #Viral #Startup
- 2-3 niche hashtags: #Sora2 #N8N #Automation
- 1-2 trending hashtags: Check TikTok Discover page daily
- Max 5 hashtags total (TikTok algorithm doesn't favor hashtag stuffing)

**TikTok Algorithm Hacks:**
1. **First 3 seconds = everything** - Hook must be instant
2. **Watch time matters more than likes** - Create loops, cliffhangers
3. **Comments = gold** - Ask questions, create debate ("Which one?" "Tag a friend")
4. **Shares > Likes** - "Send this to someone who needs to see it"
5. **Post consistently** - Daily for 10 days trains algorithm
6. **Respond to ALL comments in first hour** - Boosts engagement signals
7. **Duet/Stitch own videos** - Creates additional content, extends reach
8. **Use trending sounds** - Check Trending tab, add popular audio if relevant

**TikTok Caption Formula:**
```
[Hook line - creates curiosity]

[2-3 lines explaining context]

[Call-to-action question or tag instruction]

#Hashtag #Hashtag #Hashtag
```

**TikTok vs Instagram Reels:**
- **TikTok:** Raw, authentic, trend-driven, younger audience
- **Instagram:** Polished, aesthetic, curated, broader age range
- **Strategy:** Post to TikTok first (native), then cross-post to Reels 2 hours later

## ⚡ 3-DAY RAPID BLITZ DEPLOYMENT PLAN

### **GOAL: Post everything in 72 hours, test algorithm, build momentum fast, clear inventory for new batch**

**Why 3-Day Blitz Works:**
- Creates content avalanche effect (algorithm sees you're active)
- Tests what resonates quickly (double down on winners)
- Clears inventory fast for next wave of videos
- Multiple touchpoints = higher audience retention
- FOMO effect: "This creator is everywhere right now"

**Posting Frequency:**
- **Day 1 (Sunday Oct 13):** 3 posts (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Day 2 (Monday Oct 14):** 3 posts (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Day 3 (Tuesday Oct 15):** 3 posts (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Total:** 9 videos in 72 hours

**Video Tier Strategy:**

**🥉 TIER 3 (Test the Waters) - Day 1:**
- Start with good-but-not-best videos
- Test platform responses
- Build baseline engagement
- Low risk if something goes wrong

**🥈 TIER 2 (Build Momentum) - Day 2:**
- Mid-level viral potential
- Capitalize on Day 1 engagement
- Start building pattern recognition with audience
- Increase stakes gradually

**🥇 TIER 1 (Mega Finish) - Day 3:**
- Deploy the nuclear options
- Maximum viral potential
- Ride the momentum from Days 1-2
- Leave them wanting more for next batch
