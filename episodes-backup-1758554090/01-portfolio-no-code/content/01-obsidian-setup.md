# Free Productivity Stack

Before we build, let me show you my secret weapon - Obsidian.

## Cost Comparison
- Notion: $20/month, data on their servers
- Miro: $16/month, just for diagrams
- Roam: $15/month, for note-taking
- **Obsidian: FREE forever**

## Why Markdown Files Matter
Your notes are just `.md` files on YOUR computer. When other apps die, your markdown lives forever.

## Essential Plugins
- **Excalidraw**: Replaces Miro for diagramming
- **Git**: Version control for your knowledge
- **Templates**: Rapid note creation

## Sync Options
1. **iCloud** (Free for Apple ecosystem)
2. **Git** (Free, recommended)
3. **Obsidian Sync** ($4/month if you want zero config)
